// Q102: Write a Program to take a sorted array arr[] and an integer x as input, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x and print it. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, print -1. Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n, x;

    scanf("%d", &n);

    int arr[n];

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &arr[i]);
    }

    scanf("%d", &x);

    int index = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] >= x) {
            index = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d", index);

    return 0;
}
